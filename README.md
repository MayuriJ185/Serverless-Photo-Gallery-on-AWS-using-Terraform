# 🚀 AWS Lambda Deployment with Terraform

## 📘Overview

This repository showcases the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) deployment of an AWS Lambda function using Terraform. It automates the provisioning of necessary AWS resources and integrates a packaged Lambda function (lambda.zip) into the workflow. The project demonstrates a real-world scenario where scalable and repeatable deployment pipelines are essential for cloud-native applications.

--- 

## 🎯 Project Goal

The objective of this project is to simplify the serverless application deployment process by using Terraform to:
- Automate infrastructure provisioning on AWS
- Deploy a pre-built Lambda function package
- Enable reproducible, version-controlled deployments
This approach eliminates manual AWS Console configurations and fosters infrastructure consistency, agility, and scalability.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **IaC**: Terraform
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS
- **Compute**:	AWS Lambda
- **Language Runtime**: Python (assumed for Lambda)
- **State Management**:	Remote/local Terraform backend

## 🧩 Key Features

- Modular Terraform Scripts: Clean, reusable code blocks to define AWS resources
- IAM Role Management: Secure execution roles and permissions for Lambda
- Zip-based Lambda Deployment: Uses pre-packaged code (lambda.zip) for deployment
- State Tracking: Tracks infrastructure changes through Terraform state files

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Components
### AWS Lambda Function
- Deploys a function from a .zip archive
- Configures runtime, timeout, memory, and handler

### IAM Role & Policy
- Grants minimum required permissions for Lambda execution

### Terraform State
- Maintains a snapshot of deployed infrastructure

---

## 🧠 Learning Highlights

- Infrastructure automation using Terraform
- Best practices for serverless deployment
- Secure IAM role configuration
- Versioned and reproducible cloud infrastructure

---

## 💡 Use Cases

- Rapid deployment of event-driven serverless applications
- Automated environment provisioning for testing or CI/CD
- Infrastructure templates for AWS Lambda microservices

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integrate with API Gateway for real-time invocation
